Some hacks to get WebKit's Web Inspector to run as a plain old web page

The basic idea here is that for some types of work that you can do to Web
Inspector, it's just as easy to do them treating Web Inspector as a plain
old web page.  This rules out a lot of types of work, for instance anything
that (currently) involves having a web page, scripts, etc loaded.  Basically,
testing the initial empty layout is all you can do now.  But sometimes that's
good enough.

In the future, I'd like to see if this can be enhanced to fooling the Web
Inspector code into believing it actually is running, by making calls back
into the code itself to tell it that it loaded files, resources, scripts,
etc.  We'll see.

To use this:

- run the create-links.py script to create links to WebKit directories in the
  current directory. 
 
- edit the front-end/inspector.html file and add the line
     <script type="text/javascript" src="../mock-wi.js"></script>
  before any of the other script elements.  Note that this is modifying the
  inspector.html file in your base WebKit directory - you won't want to
  include this on any patches!  It's safe to run Web Inspector with WebKit
  this way; the file won't be found and thus will be ignored.
 
- launch the mock Web Inspector by opening the file mock-wi.html; this
  redirects to front-end/inspector.html, but I've had better luck going
  through the redirect logic than opening inspector.html directly; the links
  interpreted differently somehow.
